### Open Source Incident Management using Slack
<br>
RespondNow is an open source incident management server that runs on Kubernetes managed by you. It comes with a slack application for collaborating on the incident responses. 


### RespondNow goals
- Build a free and easy to use incident management tool that operates entirely in your slack workspace. Make the collaboration around incident response native to your existing mode of collaboration.
- Bring together a community of developers and SREs that contribute to the buildup of reusable runbooks.
