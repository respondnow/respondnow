**Incident Management Server**: This is the core of RespondNow, responsible for processing and managing all incident-related data and operations. It provides the foundational backend that powers the entire framework.

**Slack App**: This is the primary interface for users. It allows teams to perform critical incident management tasks directly within their communication tool, making it easier to stay on top of incidents without switching contexts.

**Incident Dashboard**: This component offers a visual interface where users can monitor, manage, and gain insights into ongoing incidents. The portal provides a centralized view, enabling better coordination and decision-making throughout the incident lifecycle.

By bringing together powerful features and ease of use, RespondNow helps teams respond to incidents faster, collaborate more effectively, and maintain control over complex incident management processes.
