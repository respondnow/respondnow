# View Incident Details

- Incident details are captured in the respective war-rooms, which one can join from the designated incident channel. These
war-rooms typically contain additional information, gathered as a result of user comments, attachments etc.,

- If you have been assigned a role in any of the incidents, you will receive a notification on the app channel's message tab
  along with the war-room link.

  of `/list open incidents` or `list closed incidents`
